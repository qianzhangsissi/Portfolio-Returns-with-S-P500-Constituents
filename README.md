# Portfolio-Returns-with-S-P500-Constituents
## Overview
This project is focused on the analysis of individual stock returns and portfolio returns, using data from the S&P 500 constituents. It aims to familiarize users with Python for finance applications, including data retrieval, return calculations, statistical analysis of stock and portfolio returns, and the exploration of different portfolio weighting strategies.

## Getting Started
1. Prerequisites
(1). Python 3.x
(2). Jupyter Notebook
(3). Pandas library
(4). NumPy library
(5). Matplotlib library

2. Installation
(1). Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/finance-data-analysis-project.git
(2). Navigate to the project directory:
cd finance-data-analysis-project
(3). Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Data Files
The project uses three main data files:
adj_price.csv: Adjusted close prices for approximately 471 S&P 500 stocks from July 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020.
Market capitalization data (sourced from CRSP).
Other supplemental data files as needed for advanced portfolio strategies.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (a1.ipynb) in the project directory.
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the analysis. The notebook is divided into sections corresponding to each question and analysis type:
(1). Analysis of individual stock returns
(2). Analysis of value-weighted portfolio returns
(3). Analysis of equal-weighted portfolio returns
(4). Bonus: Analysis of capped value-weighted portfolio returns
Each section includes detailed instructions for performing the analysis, as well as prompts for discussion based on the findings.

## Project Structure
